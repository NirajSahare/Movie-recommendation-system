# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using Python and machine learning techniques. The system suggests movies based on user preferences by leveraging content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. It processes movie data, extracts relevant features, and provides personalized recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TensorFlow (optional for deep learning)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset:** Dataset file is given

## 📊 Features
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on similarity in genres, descriptions, and keywords.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies based on user preferences and interactions.
- **TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity:** Used for measuring movie similarities.
- **User Input Support:** Users can enter a movie name to receive relevant recommendations.

## 📌 Usage
1. Enter the name of a movie in the input prompt.
2. The system will analyze the data and suggest similar movies.
3. View results with details like genre, ratings, and summaries.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Implement a **hybrid recommendation model** combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
- Develop a **web-based interface** using Flask or Streamlit.
- Integrate **deep learning techniques** for improved recommendations.
